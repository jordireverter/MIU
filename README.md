# CV Website

## Project Analysis

### User Profile

The user persona for this website is **Jordi Reverter Palmada**, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Girona. Jordi is seeking to showcase his professional background, skills, and academic journey in a modern and appealing way. He aims to have an online presence that demonstrates his knowledge in technology, programming, and AI. As a student, he is focused on providing a professional yet approachable look that will catch the attention of potential employers or collaborators. Jordi values clarity and ease of navigation, with clear contact information and sections for his experience, education, and skills. His target audience includes potential recruiters, professors, and professional contacts in the field of Computer Science.

### Information Architecture

The website is structured with the goal of providing a clean, easy-to-navigate experience. It is divided into several distinct sections:
1. **Header**: Contains the personal information, profile picture, and contact details (phone, email, location, and GitHub link). This section is designed to immediately introduce the user with a visual focus on the profile picture and name.
2. **Main Content**: The left section of the page includes three subsections: **Languages**, **Skills**, and **Interests**. These sections provide detailed insights into the user's qualifications, soft skills, and areas of interest in technology. 
3. **Experience & Education**: This part showcases Jordi's work history and academic achievements. It is presented in a clear, readable format with job titles, dates, and descriptions of responsibilities and achievements.
4. **Visual Balance**: The design has a dual-column layout to balance the profile section and the more extensive content about experience and education. The main content area is larger than the contact area to emphasize the more detailed sections.
  
Overall, the structure is user-friendly, with clear headings and sections to ensure that visitors can find information quickly.

### Visual Design

The visual design of the CV website is centered on modern, dynamic aesthetics that make use of a professional yet approachable color scheme. The primary colors are **blues**, with a gradient header that transitions between a **deep blue** and **aquamarine**, creating a visually appealing background. Accent colors are used sparingly, with a **vibrant orange** for interactive elements such as hover states and icons. This choice of colors reflects a sense of energy, while maintaining professionalism.

Key decisions include:
1. **Profile Picture Emphasis**: The profile picture is enlarged, framed with a bold border, and given a hover effect to create an interactive experience that draws attention to the userâ€™s face.
2. **Typography**: A clean, readable font ("Roboto") was chosen to ensure legibility. Headings are bold and large, which helps create a clear hierarchy, while body text remains smaller for easy reading.
3. **Layout**: The page uses a grid layout with two columns, making it more visually dynamic without feeling cluttered. The content is spaced out to ensure a modern and spacious look. The left side includes important sections like languages and skills, while the right side focuses on work experience and education.
4. **Subtle Animations**: The gradient background in the header, which shifts every 6 seconds, adds a touch of dynamism to the design. Additionally, the profile picture grows slightly on hover, providing a sense of interactivity.
5. **Iconography**: The GitHub link features the **Font Awesome GitHub icon** for easy recognition, enhancing the visual appeal and accessibility of the contact section.
